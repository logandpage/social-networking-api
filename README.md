# An Api for Social Networking

This is a working api for social networking applications. It has been tested using Insomnia. You can create, delete, update and view users as all and by their ID. You can also add and delete friends. There is also a thoughts option where, like users, you can create, delete, update, and view thoughts as all or by individual ID's. You can also add and delete reactions for thoughts.
